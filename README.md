# How to play

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

After installing the app and opening in a web browser, you will see some cute cat pictures. You can click on them as much as you can and you will see how many times you have clicked on each cat's picture.

You can also add your own cat's picture in the `src/js/app.js` file:

`const allCats = [
	{
		name: 'Cat's name',
		src: 'Cat's image',
		counter: 0
	}
]`
